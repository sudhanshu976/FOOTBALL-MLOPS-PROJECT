**MLOps Project Documentation: Player Transfer Fee Prediction**

**1. Overview:**
This MLOps project focuses on predicting a football player's transfer fee based on various features such as team, position, age, appearances, minutes played, games injured, awards, and current value. The project is implemented using Flask for the web application and incorporates a prediction pipeline for streamlined model inference.

**2. Project Structure:**
- **`app.py`:** The main Flask application file containing routes for home and prediction.
- **`templates/`:** Directory containing HTML templates for rendering web pages.
    - **`index.html`:** Home page template with a form for user input.
    - **`result.html`:** Result page template displaying the predicted transfer fee.
- **`src/`:** Directory containing project source code.
    - **`pipeline/`:** Module containing the `PredictPipeline` class responsible for preprocessing input data and making predictions.
    - **`predict_pipeline.py`:** Script defining the `PredictPipeline` class and its methods.
    
**3. Flask Application Routes:**

- **`/` (Home Route):**
  - Displays the home page with a form for users to input player details.
  - Renders `index.html`.

- **`/predict` (Prediction Route):**
  - Receives user input from the form, preprocesses the data, and makes a prediction using the `PredictPipeline` class.
  - Renders `result.html` displaying the predicted transfer fee.

**4. `PredictPipeline` Class:**
- **`__init__`:** Initializes the pipeline, loading any required models or preprocessing steps.
- **`preprocess_input(data)`:** Handles data preprocessing tasks such as scaling and encoding.
- **`make_prediction(data)`:** Invokes the trained model to make a transfer fee prediction.

**5. How to Run:**
1. Ensure Python and required packages are installed (`pip install Flask pandas`).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

**6. Notes:**
- The project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting football player transfer fees.
- Users can input player details through the web form, and the application utilizes the MLOps pipeline to make accurate predictions.

**7. Further Development:**
- The model and preprocessing steps in the `PredictPipeline` class can be enhanced or replaced as needed.
- Consider integrating continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) for a more automated and efficient workflow.
